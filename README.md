# TheoryOfAlgo_CountdownProject
The aim of this project is to recreate the popular math game from the show Countdown using Scheme with the Dr.Racket IDE. The computer randomly selects six numbers that will either be a collection of small numbers(from 1 to 10) and larger ones(25, 50, 75 and 100). The user will then need to answer the randomly generated number based on the numbers that are chosen. For example, if 1, 3, 5, 6, 25 and 50 are selected, then the computer may ask the user to try to get 554 as their answer using the mentioned number.
